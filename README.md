This is a 2D side scroller set to the theme of Poke'mon.
It has multiple levels, and a save option so players can pick up where they left off

Initially it was a project for an object orientated class, but I have sience then expanded on it.

Written in Java, and run in eclipse, it should work on any machine that have a JDK.
